# Mind Swipe Web

[My Notes](notes.md)

This is an attempt to recreate the game called **"Mind Swipe"** and can have several levels of complexity. These will include following simple directions, matching colors, decoding a phrase of words, and doing all of this quickly to meet the time limit.


## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you felt like there's no new ideas? Like every game you find is another remake? Mind Swipe Web is here to help you with that! As a simple and fun game, Mind Swipe Web consists of matching simple code phrases with corners of your screen and passing each level.

### Design

    Levels->>Main Menu: Fail, click 'Retry'
```

### Key features

- Pressing the arrow keys will be how you interact with this game, whether you follow the directions or not!
- The main menu will have a 'Play' option
- The levels screen will have an option to return to the 'Main Menu'
- While on the levels screen if you get one wrong you will be shown a screen that says 'Retry'

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - html will give me the basic blocks, the buttons, the screens, and the score
- **CSS** - css will help me change the color of each side of the screen and the word each time
- **React** - display and update the score - maybe lives too
- **Service** - retrieving the high score, display a new xkcd comic each new high score (xkcd API)
- **DB/Login** - stores the high score and the set of prompts for each level
- **WebSocket** - updating the overall high score (below player high score)

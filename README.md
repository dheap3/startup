# Mind Swipe Web

[My Notes](notes.md)

This is an attempt to recreate the game called **"Mind Swipe"** and can have several levels of complexity. These will include following simple directions, matching colors, decoding a phrase of words, and doing all of this quickly to meet the time limit.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you felt like there's no new ideas? Like every game you find is another remake? Mind Swipe Web is here to help you with that! As a simple and fun game, Mind Swipe Web consists of matching simple code phrases with corners of your screen and passing each level.

### Design

    Levels->>Main Menu: Click 'Main Menu'
    Levels->>Main Menu: Fail, click 'Retry'
```

### Key features

- Pressing the arrow keys will be how you interact with this game, whether you follow the directions or not!
- The main menu will have a 'Play' option
- The levels screen will have an option to return to the 'Main Menu'
- While on the levels screen if you get one wrong you will be shown a screen that says 'Retry'

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - html will give me the basic blocks, the buttons, the screens, and the score
- **CSS** - css will help me change the color of each side of the screen and the word each time
- **React** - display and update the score - maybe lives too
- **Service** - retrieving the high score
- **DB/Login** - stores the high score and the set of prompts for each level
- **WebSocket** - updating the high score

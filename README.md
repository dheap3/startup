# Mind Swipe Web

[My Notes](notes.md)

This is an attempt to recreate the game called **"Mind Swipe"** and can have several levels of complexity. These will include following simple directions, matching colors, decoding a phrase of words, and doing all of this quickly to meet the time limit.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

### Elevator pitch

Have you felt like there's no new ideas? Like every game you find is another remake? Mind Swipe Web is here to help you with that! As a simple and fun game, Mind Swipe Web consists of matching simple code phrases with corners of your screen and passing each level.
